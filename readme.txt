Customify is a Theme Customizer Booster that you can easily use to add Fonts, Colors, Live CSS Editor and other options to your theme.

== Description ==

With [Customify](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify), developers can easily create **advanced theme-specific options** inside the WordPress Customizer. Using those options, a user can make presentational changes without having to know or edit the theme code.

**Types of Fields**

* **Color.** A color picker used to control any text or background color of an element.

* **Typography.** A series of typographic options that allow you to access the massive **Google Fonts library** and make them available inside your theme customizer.

* **CSS Editor.** A powerful **Live CSS Editor** directly into your customizer! Useful for better control over the appearance of your theme without the need to create a child theme or worry about theme updates overwriting your customizations.

* **Text Field.** A simple text field that allows you to customize elements like Site Title or Footer Credits.

* **Select Dropdown.** A drop-down menu selector to be used when you have to choose from multiple options.

* **Range.** The html5 range element can be used to select number values.

* **[Preset](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify/blob/master/README.md#presets_title).** A field which allows you to change a group of Customify fields.

Reset buttons are available for all the options or for individual sections or panels.
They are disabled by default to avoid useless/accidental resets.
